The brand-new AI system and open environments allow enemies to work together to capture and corner Leon. Enemies are now humans, which allows them to climb up ladders, open doors, and use weapons throughout the game.

Next, ride across a bridge to the other side of a river, plant some C4, set up an ammo drop, go prone, and wait for another vehicle to pass by so you can blow it up. Next, you get a message that a Jeep is transporting a prisoner you need to extract. It\'s across the river. User your sniper rifle to kill the driver and guard, run across the river, extract the prisoner, park the Jeep in the middle of the road so that it stops the next vehicle that is coming your way.

Don\'t just shut off the lights--shut off the lights, plant C4 on the power source, and then blow up the guy who comes by to turn the lights on.

Even though the game is relatively difficult (for me, anyway), it always feels fair. It\'s always clear what killed me, and successfully completing a mission is less a matter of just getting better at doing a specific thing and more a matter of changing tactics. Enemy behavior is some of the most realistic and immersive I\'ve seen in a stealth game. Sure, you can cheese the AI, but you really have to work for it, instead of just going round the corner so the enemies forget your presence.

I wouldn\'t so much call this an open world game as an open arena game or a semi-sandbox game or something equally clunky.  The goal of the open world in this game is not so much to simulate a living, breathing world (like Skyrim or Far Cry 4), but to give you a large area of operations for your missions. It succeeds in that regard, but I do wish there had been some more dynamic events happening. My other complaint is with the base management portion of the game--it feels like a mobile game, and takes away from the action. I want to be sneaking around and shooting stuff, not clicking through a menu.\n                     \n                     These are small complaints, however, and I can safely say that this game is one of the best games I have ever played.

Their path is marked on your Pip Boy. Call in a supply drop for a grenade launcher up ahead, then ride on your horse to get ahead of a tank, pick up the grenade launcher, and ambush the tank. Next, ride across a bridge to the other side of a river, plant some C4, set up an ammo drop, go prone, and wait for another vehicle to pass by so you can blow it up. Next, you get a message that a Jeep is transporting a prisoner you need to extract. It\'s across the river. User your sniper rifle to kill the driver and guard, run across the river, extract the prisoner, park the Jeep in the middle of the road so that it stops the next vehicle that is coming your way.

Instead of just shutting down the radios at a base, you can destroy their comms equipment, their anti-air radar, and their electrical power. Don\'t just shut off the lights--shut off the lights, plant C4 on the power source, and then blow up the guy who comes by to turn the lights on.  But be careful, because the enemies will react to anything you do. Keep turning the lights off and they will start wearing night-vision goggles.\n                     \n                     The amount of things you can do in this game is amazing. Even though the game is relatively difficult (for me, anyway), it always feels fair. It\'s always clear what killed me, and successfully completing a mission is less a matter of just getting better at doing a specific thing and more a matter of changing tactics. Enemy behavior is some of the most realistic and immersive I\'ve seen in a stealth game. Sure, you can cheese the AI, but you really have to work for it, instead of just going round the corner so the enemies forget your presence.

One is that the open world really is empty; there\'s nothing besides enemy bases. I wouldn\'t so much call this an open world game as an open arena game or a semi-sandbox game or something equally clunky.  The goal of the open world in this game is not so much to simulate a living, breathing world (like Skyrim or Far Cry 4), but to give you a large area of operations for your missions. It succeeds in that regard, but I do wish there had been some more dynamic events happening.

It is the result of a collaboration between Square and The Walt Disney Company. The game combines characters and settings from Disney's animated features with those from the Final Fantasy series, developed by Square.
             

              Kingdom Hearts was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial action-adventure element. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. Kingdom Hearts was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura's first time in a directorial position.
             

              The game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes.

It is the result of a collaboration between Square and The Walt Disney Company. The game combines characters and settings from Disney's animated features with those from the Final Fantasy series, developed by Square.
             

              Kingdom Hearts was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial action-adventure element. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. Kingdom Hearts was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura's first time in a directorial position.
             

              The game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game.

In the Twilight of Edo Japan, a shinobi undertakes a secret mission. Experience these tales in any order you choose‚Äîthe adventure is yours to control.

Live a Live is a must play for anyone who enjoys Square's Super Nintendo output or anyone who wants a JRPG that doesn't play by the book."", 'This is a collection of a bunch of vignettes that all play with JRPG tropes in unique ways, and for the most part I found these stories really unique and entertaining. This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways, so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It‚Äôs mostly a very accessible game, but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game, but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho, I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me, each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively, and while it‚Äôs far from a difficult game, each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake, it‚Äôs a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original. While some chapters are definitely weaker than others, I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game. And while I won‚Äôt spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters, I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience. This definitely deserves to be considered a classic of the era right alongside FFVI and Chrono Trigger.', ""Such a creative and imaginative RPG from start to finish that I'd honestly place it among my favorites. The amount of love pumped into this remake is brimming and hard to not smile at. The battle system was fun to get ahold of and the characters were all charming to see regardless of how simple they may come off as to people (it was a bit of a blueprint for omnibus storytelling after all."", ""Honestly, there just wasn't enough here to keep me engaged. Most of the chapters don't encourage exploration, the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved, and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact. The space episode was the best one that I got to, and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points. I expect more from RPG's, even remasters of old classics. If the combat is boring, the story had better be engaging. If the story is underwhelming, I want to be excited for each battle. Neither of these is the case for this game. It truly overstayed its welcome."", ""The best soundtrack I've ever heard in a video game."", 'Rough around the edges in the gameplay department, but ultimately a compelling and well-written story about how the many forms a hero can take and the choices they make that get them there.']",1.1K,235,1.7K,1.9K,5674,live a live,SNES,1994.0,Role-Playing,SquareSoft,0.0,0.0,0.32,0.0,0.32

The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (""badniks"" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.
             

              Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.
             

              The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.
             

              At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).
             

              When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a ""Secret Zone"" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a ""goal block"" (which ends the level).","['Recomendado, pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega.

              The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.
             

              At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).
             

              When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a ""Secret Zone"" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a ""goal block"" (which ends the level).","['Recomendado, pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega.

The balance of weapons and objects in the game was adjusted to better adhere to the ""Golden Triangle of Halo"": these are weapons, grenades, and melee attacks, which are available to a player in most situations. Players may dual-wield some weapons, forgoing the use of grenades and melee attacks in favor of the combined firepower of two weapons. Many weapons available in previous installments of the series return with minor cosmetic and power alterations. Unlike previous installments, the player's secondary weapon is visible on their player model, holstered or slung across the player's back.
              
              Halo 3 introduces ""support weapons"", which are cumbersome two-handed weapons that slow the player, but offer greatly increased firepower in return.

That isn‚Äôt to say the game is the worst thing ever, but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it‚Äôs tough to recommend. The parkour system is very cool and has a lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations. Scaling towers and doing Leaps of Faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points. There are many other menial side missions that, while not lacking in variety, are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly. Play it if you‚Äôre curious as some of the stealth is fun (and a little more low key compared to later entires in the series), but don‚Äôt be surprised if it gets dull very quickly.', 'Sinceramente, eu n√£o curti. Sei que √© o primeiro jogo e que as mec√¢nicas ainda eram um rascunho, mas, caramba, √© torturante escalar, o combate n√£o tem diversidade nenhuma e o protagonista, apesar de interessante, n√£o tem quase nada de carisma, sempre falando em tom neutro e sem expressar emo√ß√£o.\n                     \n                     Para um in√≠cio, mesmo levando em conta as limita√ß√µes, ainda √© bem fraco. √â s√≥ ver que Prince of Persia fez mec√¢nicas muito mais agrad√°veis, e que este deveria ser uma evolu√ß√£o pelo menos das escaladas, mas n√£o √© o que acontece. Basicamente o jogo n√£o tem stealth, e isso matou a gra√ßa de muitas miss√µes, pois voc√™ basicamente chega no inimigo e esfaqueia, depois aperta o bot√£o para disfar√ßar. Me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer miss√µes repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos e se eu falhasse, ficava mais dif√≠cil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam l√° e os guardas ficavam em alerta, dificultando conseguir assassinar o alvo sem falhar, e as vezes os npcs (os loucos), simplesmente me empurravam, eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava a miss√£o. Eu tive 0 vontade de fazer qualquer side quest que n√£o fosse obrigado a fazer para seguir com as principais, que s√£o todas praticamente iguais e nada recompensadoras.', ""As someone who played Assassin's Creed back in the day, I have to say that I had mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, I appreciated the game's unique setting and storyline, which offered a fresh take on the action-adventure genre.

Ezio is the golden child of the series but Altair truly embodies the assassin in my mind infinitely better. Cold, calculating while still maintaining his humanity and code.

Pick up a key before talking to an NPC who tells you to go get it?

One key aspect introduced in this title is the simultaneous multiplayer: while not the first game in the series to do so, it is the first 3D title in the Mario series to incorporate up to four players cooperating with each other to reach the goal. Players can select their character from a pool of playable characters prior to starting the game, and each of these characters have their own unique playstyle that gives them advantages and disadvantages over other characters. The game makes use of several Wii U exclusive features, such as tapping blocks with the touch screen on the GamePad and blowing into the mic to reveal hidden items and blow away enemies.

The nature of the series remains generally lighthearted, something that's reinforced by its playful, anime-inspired visual style, but the nature of the crimes committed can be cold and downright disturbing. While the game's legal acumen is highly dubious, its aim seems to be more about producing comedic or stereotypically dramatic courtroom moments. Ace Attorney 3 makes light use of the DS touch screen, allowing the player to examine crime scenes and inspect evidence and character profiles. The top screen is used more for storytelling purposes, displaying various dialogue and conversations between characters.

New modes like Revenge of the King and Meta Knight Ultra await, along with classics like The Great Cave Offensive and Milky Way Wishes. On top of the main modes, there are also three new touch-screen-controlled mini-games that can be played with up to three friends via DS Download Play.

I beat this edition and played through most of the original as a kid, and I can say I never had strong memories about it aside from a few rooms. Beating it now after coming from other Kirby games, the game is plainly dated and I found myself rushing to just beat it after a while.\n                     \n                     The presentation is cute, the hybrid artstyle and cutscenes are nice to see, but as far as gameplay goes, SSU doesn\'t do too much to add from the original ‚Äî which I definitely have qualms over.\n                     \n                     Air movement is very sad in this game. Previous entries weren\'t that great in this either, but it feels extremely noticable here. Jumps are not as pronounced (wheel still did not have this at the time, but felt like it could\'ve been included),  flying (a major trait of Kirby) feels like such a pain in the ass that it\'s better to avoid it over ground movement where possible, and many of the levels contain claustrophobic designs, sometimes cram-packed with enemies on top of hazard spam (either with lava or electricity as the main suspects) which all started to blur into one another instead of giving each place an overly distinct identity (aside from stages that were a 1-off gimmick). The worst part about this is that the amount of sources that inflict Heavy Knockdown to Kirby is very grinding, which only made me want to play more impatiently and roll my eyes when trying to brush away from a hazard ends up making you waste a few seconds, killing the pacing and action often. I assume the levels were left untouched from SS, but I feel like improvements could have been made to (at least) the level design. One-gap holes you must fall into, mazes galore and some other unintuitive puzzles (specific lava being passable when the rest isn\'t) drowned my joy out.\n                     \n                     I don\'t have much to say about the rest, everyone loves Marx and Galacta Knight. Meta Knightmare felt the most fun to play and control with the energy system being cool enough, but I don\'t care too much about the ""minigame"" direction chosen. I personally prefer a centralized thing, and each segment didn\'t make me feel like replaying it. I understand why they went this route, though.\n                     \n                     There is no bad Kirby game, and if managed to 97% the game then it was partially fun enough, but I have to give it my personal ""OK"" rating that made it a bit below Squeak Squad.

Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to ‚Äúroll up‚Äù items increasing the Katamari‚Äôs size until it‚Äôs suitable for the King.
             

              Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.
             

              Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari‚Äôs size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.
             

              The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince.

It is the result of a collaboration between Square and The Walt Disney Company. The game combines characters and settings from Disney's animated features with those from the Final Fantasy series, developed by Square.
             

              Kingdom Hearts was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial action-adventure element. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. Kingdom Hearts was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura's first time in a directorial position.
             

              The game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels.","['An excellent time, The story is amazing, the worlds are fantastic to go through, and the feeling of growth is fantastic having the perfect pace imo. 100% completion of this game is this experience honestly shines (Ultima weapon being a highlight for me)', 'I don‚Äôt understand why this game exists, but the ost slaps and cloud is in it so it‚Äôs good', 'Okay, it\'s KH, it\'s confusing but this is the most grounded it\'ll get.

It is the result of a collaboration between Square and The Walt Disney Company. The game combines characters and settings from Disney's animated features with those from the Final Fantasy series, developed by Square.
             

              Kingdom Hearts was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial action-adventure element. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. Kingdom Hearts was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura's first time in a directorial position.
             

              The game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels.","['An excellent time, The story is amazing, the worlds are fantastic to go through, and the feeling of growth is fantastic having the perfect pace imo. 100% completion of this game is this experience honestly shines (Ultima weapon being a highlight for me)', 'I don‚Äôt understand why this game exists, but the ost slaps and cloud is in it so it‚Äôs good', 'Okay, it\'s KH, it\'s confusing but this is the most grounded it\'ll get.

Live a Live is a must play for anyone who enjoys Square's Super Nintendo output or anyone who wants a JRPG that doesn't play by the book."", 'This is a collection of a bunch of vignettes that all play with JRPG tropes in unique ways, and for the most part I found these stories really unique and entertaining. This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways, so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It‚Äôs mostly a very accessible game, but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game, but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho, I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me, each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively, and while it‚Äôs far from a difficult game, each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake, it‚Äôs a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original. While some chapters are definitely weaker than others, I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game. And while I won‚Äôt spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters, I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience. This definitely deserves to be considered a classic of the era right alongside FFVI and Chrono Trigger.', ""Such a creative and imaginative RPG from start to finish that I'd honestly place it among my favorites. The amount of love pumped into this remake is brimming and hard to not smile at. The battle system was fun to get ahold of and the characters were all charming to see regardless of how simple they may come off as to people (it was a bit of a blueprint for omnibus storytelling after all."", ""Honestly, there just wasn't enough here to keep me engaged. Most of the chapters don't encourage exploration, the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved, and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact. The space episode was the best one that I got to, and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points. I expect more from RPG's, even remasters of old classics. If the combat is boring, the story had better be engaging. If the story is underwhelming, I want to be excited for each battle. Neither of these is the case for this game. It truly overstayed its welcome."", ""The best soundtrack I've ever heard in a video game."", 'Rough around the edges in the gameplay department, but ultimately a compelling and well-written story about how the many forms a hero can take and the choices they make that get them there.']",1.1K,235,1.7K,1.9K,5674,live a live,SNES,1994.0,Role-Playing,SquareSoft,0.0,0.0,0.32,0.0,0.32

The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (""badniks"" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.
             

              Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.
             

              The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.
             

              At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).
             

              When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a ""Secret Zone"" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a ""goal block"" (which ends the level).","['Recomendado, pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega.

If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).
             

              When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a ""Secret Zone"" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a ""goal block"" (which ends the level).","['Recomendado, pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega.

I would give this one a try if you like 2D platformers, it seriously is a classic."", 'Here‚Äôs a pressing question for all you gamers under the age of thirty: do you actively avoid playing games from the pre-3D era because of their lack of availability, or because their foundation is comparatively primitive, and therefore jarringly inaccessible? The reason can‚Äôt be because these games are locked in an archival vault, for they are commonly ported to modern platforms. It must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date. C‚Äômon, fess up. I‚Äôm not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections, but there seems to be a widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception, especially those of the early pixelated 2D period released before the late 1990s. A sneering distaste for the classics isn‚Äôt as pervasive with films or music. Zoomers will attend theater screenings of 2001: A Space Odyssey high as a kite and emphatically detail their ‚Äútranscendental experience‚Äù to their peers with a Pulp Fiction poster in the background of their dorm rooms. No one is delusional enough to place the prequels or Disney Star Wars films over the immortal original trilogy regardless of their age. Maybe it‚Äôs because I spend too much time on the internet, but I‚Äôve noticed that discovering older music artists via the world wide web is a more common practice among teenagers now than it was when I was in high school. Older video games, on the other hand, are treated with the same reaction of revulsion as if they were being forced to eat their brussels sprouts. Admittedly, as someone born in the early 3D era, many of the industry practices and comparatively primitive facets of game design can verge on being excruciating. I can count merely a handful of games that were released before I was born that are among my personal favorites, as there is only so much pain I can handle before my spirit shatters and I am in dire need of a relaxing bath with some chocolate ice cream for comfort. Conversely, there are plenty of those whose gaming prime was this jagged era, and the shift to 3D left them bewildered. They‚Äôve assigned themselves to the role of gaming elder statesmen, whose repertoire is cryogenically frozen to the time before the medium became polygonal. After a certain point where the gaming industry reached a point of proficiency with 3D visuals to an almost cinematic extent, games that resembled those of the primeval pixelated years started popping out of the indie woodwork. One of the first breakout titles in this new wave of old-school revival games was Shovel Knight, a 2D side scroller that arguably bridged the generational gap of gamers.']",8.5K,135,1.9K,1.2K,9362,shovel knight,3DS,2015.0,Platform,Yacht Club Games,0.07,0.04,0.01,0.01,0.13

The game builds upon the previous installment, following a similar 3D level-design convention inspired from the 2D platformer titles where players must navigate through a linear-designed level within a time limit to reach a level's Goal Pole. One key aspect introduced in this title is the simultaneous multiplayer: while not the first game in the series to do so, it is the first 3D title in the Mario series to incorporate up to four players cooperating with each other to reach the goal. Players can select their character from a pool of playable characters prior to starting the game, and each of these characters have their own unique playstyle that gives them advantages and disadvantages over other characters. The game makes use of several Wii U exclusive features, such as tapping blocks with the touch screen on the GamePad and blowing into the mic to reveal hidden items and blow away enemies. Various new power-ups are introduced in this title, with the trademark suit being the Cat power-up, which enables characters to perform a melee attack, climb up walls, and leap while midair, as well as the game generally having a cat-based theme.","['√â o meu game de plantaforma preferido, ja zerei diversas vezes, e nunca deixa de ser divertido.

Players take on the role of Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney known for taking on seemingly impossible cases. While the game focuses on a few specific cases, the overarching story of the Phoenix Wright franchise spans the length of the series, involving obscure characters from large families and intricate webs of lies, plots, and murder. The nature of the series remains generally lighthearted, something that's reinforced by its playful, anime-inspired visual style, but the nature of the crimes committed can be cold and downright disturbing. While the game's legal acumen is highly dubious, its aim seems to be more about producing comedic or stereotypically dramatic courtroom moments. Ace Attorney 3 makes light use of the DS touch screen, allowing the player to examine crime scenes and inspect evidence and character profiles. The top screen is used more for storytelling purposes, displaying various dialogue and conversations between characters. During these sequences the lower screen becomes a selection menu, displaying a series of questions to ask witnesses and further your investigation in search of evidence to use in defense of your client in each chapter.","['Ace Attorney at its best.

Interactive Entertainment, which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium.
             

              The game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life.
             

              The game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor.
             

              The melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier.
             

              A unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they're off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter.","['It has combat from arkham and assassins creed, Climbing from uncharted, stealth from every 7th gen third person game, you spend half of the time clearing out bandit camps, and you play the most ai generated character in all of gaming.

The worst part about this is that the amount of sources that inflict Heavy Knockdown to Kirby is very grinding, which only made me want to play more impatiently and roll my eyes when trying to brush away from a hazard ends up making you waste a few seconds, killing the pacing and action often. I assume the levels were left untouched from SS, but I feel like improvements could have been made to (at least) the level design.

              Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.
             

              Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari‚Äôs size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.

It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.
             

              The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.
             

              The game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010).

The gameplay consists of two primary modes: Mission and Mother Base. Mission are the actual action sequences of the game where the player must infiltrate an enemy territory or fight a boss, whereas Mother Base is an army management. Some changes have been made to the standard Metal Gear formula: the player is now unable to move or shoot while laying down and while pinned to a wall, making Peace Walker the first game since Metal Gear to lack any crawling ability.","['8.8', 'Holy shit I cannot stress enough to get friends if you want to play this. Levels are kinda simple and bosses are damage sponges, which makes playing this by yourself depressing. With a friend though, this game is an absolute blast. Bumbling around through the stealth sections with one friend and taking on the bosses with 3 friends is awesome and the highlight of this game. When I first played this by myself I was convinced this was the worst one, but then going back to play this with a friend going through the series for the first time I had a total blast.', 'Peace Walker is by all accounts a worthy canonical chapter in the saga, with its own dignity in terms of the themes covered and consideration for the in-depth development of the characters. On the gameplay experience aspects, it is also a pretty good transposition of the mechanics from previous games to a handheld console, especially considering the major limitations of the psp: clearly affected by this are mainly the ai of the enemies, the complexity of the environments and a certain overall fluidity of the experience, which can initially seem quite clunky. Good choices were therefore to model the gameplay in a relatively short mission structure, to increase action sequences over stealth phases and to be inspired by the type of games proposed by the highly successful titles on psp, such as Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The result is a very fun game with various customization options and a very high level of replayability with an almost arcade-like flavor in improving your gaming execution, that may annoy those who rightly believe that such a title deserved more attention, but which in the end, considering the finished product, turns out to be decidedly remarkable.', 'gud game', 'live laugh love kazuhira miller', 'Paz e amor']",4K,68,1.3K,566,800,metal gear solid: peace walker,PSP,2010.0,Action,Konami Digital Entertainment,0.46,0.42,0.96,0.25,2.09

Your goal is to unravel a deep and twisted plot and come to terms with the recent death of your wife and child. If this sounds a bit too cerebral never fear. Your path to recapturing your sense of humanity hinges on the destruction of countless vicious monsters and the exploration of dark and dangerous dungeons.

Players expecting a similar experience to previously mentioned games would be in for a big surprise, as this title lacked all the tropes you would expect in a typical RPG; no levels, no parties, no item shops, no grinding.

645,tekken 3,"Mar 22, 1997","['Namco', 'Namco Hometek']",3.9,564,564,['Fighting'],"Tekken 3 maintains the same core fighting system and concept as its predecessors, but brings many improvements, such as significantly more detailed graphics and animations, fifteen new characters added to the game's roster, more modern music and faster and more fluid gameplay.
              
              Perhaps the most noticeable change from Tekken 2 fight system is movement reform - whereas the element of depth had been largely insignificant in previous Tekken games (aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers), Tekken 3 added emphasis on the third axis, allowing all characters to sidestep in or out of the background by lightly pressing the arcade stick (or tapping the controller button in the console version) towards the corresponding direction. Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws.
             

              Tekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up minigame called ""Tekken Force"", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3. There is also a minigame ""Tekken Ball"", similar to beach volleyball, where one has to hit the ball with a powerful attack to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent's area, thus causing damage.","['Deserves the praises that it gets. Revolutionized the 3D fighting game genre, and is basically the Street Fighter 2 for 3D fighters.', ""you'd think that after tekken 2 set the bar so high, that there would be nowhere to go but down from here, but they just kept making the game even better. We have an entirely new fresh set of characters here, the gameplay has been polished to a fine sheen, and theres a TON of bonus modes you can play that inadvertently give you practice for the main fighting mode, which is awesome since the normal training mode labbing can sometimes not be everyones cup of tea. The other gamemodes also give lonely fighters like myself much more to do than just playing arcade mode and getting clapped by dumb AI enemies over and over. This is pretty much the golden standard of tekken, and there's a reason why this game is rated so highly not just among tekken games, but even among fighting game titles and overall PS1 games."", 'The first\n                     \n                      truly\n                     \n                     3d fighting game, you can get some really spectacular fights especially if you know what you\'re doing (which i don\'t).

The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's ""boost"" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts.
             

              Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.","[""definitely more cutscene than game here, i wasn't doing much with the controller through this game.

Ported by Bluepoint Games, the collection was released exclusively for the PlayStation 4 on October 7, 2015 in Europe and October 9th, 2015 in North America.
             

              The Nathan Drake Collection features the original three games in the Uncharted series with 1080p resolution, 60 frames per second, better lighting, textures and models. The collection also implements a ""Photo Mode"", a mode where the player can freeze the game at any moment to take personalized screenshots, derived from Naughty Dog's other remastered entry, The Last of Us Remastered, as well as new trophies. The ported games only include their respective single-player modes.
             

              The pre-ordered version of The Nathan Drake Collection includes the ""Nathan Drake Pack"", which consists of single-player skins of iconic Nathan Drake outfits, as well as two weapons: the Golden AK-47 and Golden 92FS - 9mm. Pre-ordering the collection as a digital download through the PlayStation Store would also give an exclusive Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection PlayStation 4 dynamic theme.

The worlds are ludicrous in size, the gameplay is polished and deep, and the soundtrack proves to be an immaculate compliment. When it comes to defining platform-based entertainment, Banjo-Tooie is filled with chapter after chapter of standards. Explore eight giant worlds, solve puzzles and help game characters to unearth jiggys, play as Mumbo, a T-Rex, Submarine, Money-Van, Washing Machine, and more, and learn more than 40 new moves on the way.","[""I already love Banjo-Kazooie.

A lot of its charm comes from the humorous dialogue between characters. It‚Äôs packed with quite a bit of dark humor and situational comicalities throughout each of the 9 worlds.\n                     \n                     The worlds are vast and eclectic, meaning you‚Äôre left with very little to be desired and a lot to explore.\n                     \n                     Being a sequel to Banjo Kazooie, Tooie has a lot to live up to and it did not disappoint.

What this means is you can collect 99 music notes in a world, leave and come back, and you‚Äôll have to start back at 0. Whereas in Tooie, everything you collect is permanent and you don‚Äôt need to worry about losing progress.\n                     \n                     Tooie is a lot more legato when it comes to how the worlds are interconnected and honestly that was something I really loved when playing it.\n                     \n                     Oh, the camera is much better in Tooie too.\n                     \n                     A common complaint I see is that there‚Äôs an overwhelming amount of content and people that played Tooie after Kazooie thought that took away from the experience.

This is something I think Banjo Tooie does extremely well. There are consistently new unlockables whether it‚Äôs new combat moves, mobility utilities, worlds, secret paths, etc, there‚Äôs always something new. However, because there‚Äôs so much, there is a LOT of backtracking, especially if you want to collect everything. For me this was a good thing, but I know it‚Äôs not for everyone.\n                     \n                     There are many places in each world where you can get stuck due to not having unlocked something elsewhere or just not being able to figure out a puzzle. As a child, this was a fun challenge. I cannot tell what it would be like playing for the first time as an adult.\n                     \n                     I‚Äôd be lying if I said nostalgia didn‚Äôt have something to do with how I feel about this game. But I assure you, both playing (and 100%ing) as a kid as well as in my 20‚Äôs I gave this a solid 10/10.\n                     \n                     There‚Äôs also a multiplayer mode which are all the mini games banjo and kazooie come across in the campaign.

It is also the third and final Fire Emblem series title to be released on the Super Famicom.
             

              Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 takes place between Chapters 5 and 6 of the previous game, Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu. Several characters from Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu appear, such as Leaf, Fin, and Nanna. It takes place in the Thracian peninsula in southeastern Jugdral.","[""There's genuinely nothing funny I could say about Thracia, or anything that hasn't already been said about it that would do it justice. There's no other FE game that matches its raw gameplay integrity and absolutely genius ideas, with Genealogy at least coming in close second. For every bullshit thing the game throws at you, the game gives you quadruple the amount of bullshit to use against the enemy - like there are so many brave and master weapons and staves that basically get handed to you on a silver platter, and while there are a few chapters that are trial and error, actually figuring them out genuinely feels so good - no other Fire Emblem game gives me this much dopamine. Hell, I made a long ass text file documenting my experiences with the game, going in depth on every strategy I utilised in every chapter and giving pointers and advice that either myself or someone else could use whenever they decide to play. I think it's worth mentioning that this is the first time a game has compelled me to do something like this."", 'amei as mec√¢nicas do jogo espero que apare√ßa em outros jogos ou algum futuro remake me diverti bem mais com esse comparado com o fe4\n                     \n                     envelheceu bem demais e algum dia vou revisitar mesmo com toda raiva que passei em alguns mapas', ""I'm never touching this game for the rest of my life.

I can‚Äôt believe I slept on this game/ kept it for last thinking it would be too hard for me. Despite being on the SNES, it‚Äôs an absolute masterpiece of a game, which can be attributed to the fact it tests the SNES to its limits, being the final SNES game ever made, released in 1999, nine years after the SNES‚Äôs inception, and 3 years into the N64‚Äôs lifespan. Shouzou Kaga was evidently opposed to making a Fire Emblem game on the N64, believing the 3D graphics would hurt the appearance of his characters, and that philosophy to keep the characters 2D carried over to the PS1‚Äôs Tear Ring Saga: Yutona Heroes War Chronicles. That too went well, but let‚Äôs focus on FE5.', 'This game probably took about 10 years from my lifespan but i still loved it, the infamous difficulty of the game is actually really satisfying and well balanced especially in the first half, but after chapter 18 or so is.... painful, to say the least. Still, after strategizing for hours, constantly saving and loading states and rage moments,sense of accomplishment i get from beating a stage from a 24 year old SRPG is remarkable\n                     \n                     Probably my favorite aspect about FE5 is the overall tone of it. While FE4 had it\'s fair share of dark moments, this game is straight up depressing, you actually feel how bleak and despair the situation is in every chapter. By the beggining of the game, you feel completely lost,and confused by the mechanics and the difficulty, just like Leif, feeling lost on this brutal war. You are not a group of experienced and heroic knights, leading for victory, you are mostly common folk going against a full fledged empire, and you\'re obviously going to get obliterated against such force. But as you learn the mechanics of the game and gain strong units, a hope slowly rises, and you go from ""how the hell am i going to survive from this?"" to ""Hey, i can actually do this!"" and you start to command larger armies on bigger maps. And then, you are facing with the strongest forces of the Empire. It\'s actually even harder then before, but you have so much more experince with the game,you don\'t feel as powerless as before. And after you\'ve gone through so much, beating the game and seeing those credits rolled is one of the most rewarding feelings a game can give to you\n                     \n                     This, is phenomenal storytelling, and you can only have this in a videogame, that unforgiving difficulty is one of the finest examples of storytelling through gameplay. That\'s why remake of this game is probably going to suck, since they\'ll inevatiabely tone down the difficulty.\n                     \n                     Gameplay has a surprising amount of resource management, and i love this, you can capture enemies to steal their equipment,but it\'s significantly harder and risky to do,since you\'ll deal much less and take much more damage. But since you don\'t get much chance to buy and repair weapons, you really have to pay attention the resources you have, and use them in the most efficient way to overcome challenges you face\n                     \n                     Fatigue is also a new mechanic, which if you use a unit too much, you won\'t be able to use them in the next chapter, which makes powerful units more tricky to use, adding another depth to the gameplay. You\'ll only want to use them when necessary, so you actually have a reason to use less powerful units, i gotta say this was hard to get used to, especially after i obliterated every enemy with Ayra and Larcei in FE4, but it didn\'t took long to for me to actually like it\n                     \n                     Also fantastic map designs suplements the complex gameplay mechanics brilliantly. FE5 abandons the massive maps of FE4 in favor of smaller, but focused maps with multiple objectives, and while some enemy placements made me want to torn apart my bone structure from my skin(those goddamn ballistas will give me nightmares) for the most part i really apprecieted the variety in both the map design and objectives. You have defense, escape, fog of war(which isn\'t THAT bad in my opinion) and of course normal seize missions. Also each map has it\'s own unique objective, which makes every single map even more memorable. Varied objectives makes each chapter fresh, which is something i\'ve never seen in an SRPG\n                     \n                     Weakest part of this game imo are the characters, in FE4, you have a lot of optional conversations between characters, and those conversations actually give a decent personality and development to each unit, in FE5, most of the cast has 5 lines of dialogues at most, and all of them are in the chapter you recruit them.\n                     \n                     But i really like how the game tells what happened to them after the credits rolled\n                     \n                     Though this doesn\'t mean that this game has no good character writing, far from it, Leif is one the best written main character\'s i\'ve ever seen in a game. Like i mentioned before, you start of the game as powerless, and with zero knowledge on the complex mechanics of the game. Just like Leif, who\'s a 15 year old who has never commanded an army. This is obviously no coincidence, Leif represents the player, but unlike most games that have a main character which is""representing the player""Leif isn\'t a silent protagonist, his development from an inexperienced kid to a mature war commander is very natural, and paralells brilliantly with the development of you as a player, as you understand how the game works and start using the tools you have in the most optimal ways. Leif alone is enough to say this game has fantastic character writing\n                     \n                     I\'m not sure if Fire Emblem 5 is better than 4,but still, this is one the finest SRPG\'s ever made. It\'s frusturating for sure, but it\'s so well designed in nearly every aspect, it\'s impossible for me to hate it. I\'d highly recommend it if you liked FE4, and simply want to see more from this world.']",820,65,771,329,6584,fire emblem: thracia 776,SNES,1999.0,Strategy,Nintendo,0.0,0.0,0.26,0.0,0.26

At the heart of a great stealth game is nail-biting tension and suspense. Vulnerability is stressed through risk outweighing reward. On a keyboard, all of your inputs are static. Are you pressing up?

              Seven different stories featuring different protagonists, time periods, and gameplay styles await. In The Wild West, a wanderer with a bounty on his head fights for his life. In the Twilight of Edo Japan, a shinobi undertakes a secret mission. Experience these tales in any order you choose‚Äîthe adventure is yours to control. What other stories will you uncover on the horizon...?","[""A really solid anthology of mini gold era Square RPGs lost to time, now easily accessible via this HD2D remake. Live a Live is a must play for anyone who enjoys Square's Super Nintendo output or anyone who wants a JRPG that doesn't play by the book."", 'This is a collection of a bunch of vignettes that all play with JRPG tropes in unique ways, and for the most part I found these stories really unique and entertaining. This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways, so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It‚Äôs mostly a very accessible game, but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game, but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho, I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me, each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively, and while it‚Äôs far from a difficult game, each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake, it‚Äôs a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original. While some chapters are definitely weaker than others, I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game. And while I won‚Äôt spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters, I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience. This definitely deserves to be considered a classic of the era right alongside FFVI and Chrono Trigger.', ""Such a creative and imaginative RPG from start to finish that I'd honestly place it among my favorites. The amount of love pumped into this remake is brimming and hard to not smile at. The battle system was fun to get ahold of and the characters were all charming to see regardless of how simple they may come off as to people (it was a bit of a blueprint for omnibus storytelling after all."", ""Honestly, there just wasn't enough here to keep me engaged. Most of the chapters don't encourage exploration, the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved, and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact. The space episode was the best one that I got to, and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points. I expect more from RPG's, even remasters of old classics. If the combat is boring, the story had better be engaging. If the story is underwhelming, I want to be excited for each battle. Neither of these is the case for this game. It truly overstayed its welcome."", ""The best soundtrack I've ever heard in a video game."", 'Rough around the edges in the gameplay department, but ultimately a compelling and well-written story about how the many forms a hero can take and the choices they make that get them there.']",1.1K,235,1.7K,1.9K,5674,live a live,SNES,1994.0,Role-Playing,SquareSoft,0.0,0.0,0.32,0.0,0.32

The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (""badniks"" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.
             

              Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.
             

              The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.
             

              At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).
             

              When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a ""Secret Zone"" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a ""goal block"" (which ends the level).","['Recomendado, pero tener en cuenta que es la 1era entrega.

Mario Kart Wii retains the traditional item-based weaponry familiar with the franchise, where players can select a Mario franchise driver and themed vehicles. As with most racing games, the overarching goal is to place first among other competitors, through the usage of such items and taking the fastest routes to secure the leads. Several new key elements introduced to Mario Kart Wii include increasing the number of racers to 12 racers from 8 racers from previous entries in the series, as well as introducing a new type of vehicle to the franchise: bikes. The game takes advantage of features unique to the Wii, most notably its motion control capabilities. A Wii Wheel is included in most Mario Kart Wii packages, though the game is still compatible with other controllers. Game modes are also present such as the traditional Grand Prix, Versus, Battle, and Time Trial modes.","[""Completed to fulfill a childhood dream and it's genuinely fun racing.

I played Primehack and had an enhanced FOV since the original was so narrow, so I can't comment on any original hiccups in that department. The map and world design is incredibly atmospheric, with every new area feeling like a visual treat, Phendrana Drifts in particular. Prime is a commendable transition into the 3D space for the franchise, and it being the first attempt makes all missteps easy to forgive. Backtracking is a little rough (maybe just me but I never felt like I totally got the hang of which elevator went where without double checking), the mid-game feels unfinished (you fight 3 bosses, play for 5 hours, and then fight 3 more at the tail end), and some weapons feel underutilized (I barely touched the super variants until the Metroid Prime fight) but it's a blast and really retains the feel of a 2D Metroid game at its core, with platforming as a main focus."", ""Neat game. Controls were a bit interesting to get used to, but the game is built around them so there wasn't really much of a problem. I do wish the FOV was a bit bigger and you could see where you are landing when you have to do platforming, though. This game does a good job in putting the metroid formula in 3D, but because it is now in 3D, theres a lot more nooks and crannies that things are hidden in, so you have to definitely have your eyes more peeled than the 2D metroids. The map system is also more difficult to understand than the 2D metroids. I didn't even really have a problem with the mandatory mcguffin hunt at the end or the constant backtracking, since those are kind of staples of the Metroid series and serve to give you more opportunities to find secrets by constantly returning to places you have been before. Putting a fast travel option would completely defeat the purpose imo. At the end of the day, this game didn't blow me away like it did for so many other people, but I can still see a decent game when I play one, and this is definitely that."", ""honestly i don't think there's anything out there as magical as this"", ""I wasn't satisfied with my previous review on this, so I'm just going to try again.""]",6.8K,221,2.7K,1.2K,520,metroid prime,GC,2002.0,Shooter,Nintendo,1.96,0.67,0.1,0.09,2.82

985,until dawn,"Aug 25, 2015","['Supermassive Games', 'Sony Computer Entertainment']",3.4,812,812,['Adventure'],"Until Dawn is an interactive drama survival horror video game. It was originally scheduled to be released on the PlayStation 3 and feature PlayStation Move support, but in August 2014, the game was reintroduced as a PlayStation 4 exclusive.
             

              Until Dawn is designed to be played multiple times, as players will miss out on quite a bit of content with a single playthrough. Each will last about nine hours in length and the game mechanics utilize a new in-game system called the ""Butterfly Effect"" in which any choice of action by the player may cause unforeseen consequences later on. For example, locating a weapon in an earlier chapter may allow the player to pick it up down the line when a chase scene leads back to the same room. Throughout the game, players will make difficult decisions during ethical or moral dilemmas, such as sacrificing one character to save another. The Butterfly Effect system blurs the line between right and wrong decisions and it is possible for players to keep all eight characters alive as well as having all eight of them die, allowing for many different paths and scenarios as well as offering several different endings. Until Dawn has a strict auto-save system to prevent players from reloading a previous save file to an earlier point in the game if they regret an in-game decision they have made. The only way to change the player's choice is to restart the game from the beginning or continue to the end and start a new game. In a developer interview, it has been said that Until Dawn has ""hundreds of endings"". Different endings have different variations depending on the combination of characters alive at the end of the game.
             

              The gameplay is focused on exploration, quick-time events and discovering clues as well as making decisions. There is an in-game system that will keep track of all of the clues and secrets players have discovered in total, even if there are multiple playthroughs; these clues will allow the player to piece together the mysteries of Blackwood. In terms of the gameplay mechanics and theme, Until Dawn has been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.
             

              Until Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, choice mechanic, horror elements, music, voice acting and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew was concerning the story, mostly the second half, camera angles, character movements and partially linear plot.","['Sam‚ù§Ô∏è\u200dü©π', ""i don't like this game. ive seen it all the way through like 4 times"", 'camp', ""(Played before 2023)\n                     \n                     Probably the game with the best choices in this narrative-driven style game where the choices do matter, even if they don't create much branching paths. The coolest part about this game is that, depending on your choices, everyone can survive or everyone can die and you don't really get that in many other games. I think it also had an okay story, feeling very stereotypical to make it easy for them to create characters. Voice acting and performances are okay, but there is nothing interesting about the gameplay. QTE's being essentially the only aspect of these type of games is fine, but they aren't really done in interesting ways and there isn't much else outside of this.

Pit of Kid Icarus fame is back in a new game designed specifically for the Nintendo 3DS system, by Masahiro Sakurai, creator of the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. franchises, and his development team at Project Sora.
             

              Kid Icarus: Uprising is a fast-paced and action-packed blend of aerial and ground-based shooting built on elegantly intuitive and streamlined play control. This follow-up to the original Kid Icarus released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987 has been at the top of gamers wish lists for years.
             

              Boasting gameplay that is easy to pick up but incredibly deep, the game is sure to satisfy novice gamers as well as fans who have been clamouring for a new installment in the franchise.
             

              The hero, Pit, teams up with Palutena, the goddess of light, who bestows on him the miracle of flight for limited stretches. With this gift, Pit soars through the skies, shooting down swarms of enemies, then alights and engages in frantic ground-based battles against Medusas underworld army.
             

              Find and collect numerous weapons and items that offer bonuses and ability boosts. Players can choose weapons before they send Pit into battle, giving them countless layers of strategies in each level.
             

              Players can choose between a basic Blade, basic Claws and a basic Orbitar weapon. Blades are well-balanced, Claws have limited reach but increase running speed and the Orbitars can shoot two shots that grow in power over distance.","[""another thing where if it got a remaster could be one of the very best. the controls hold it back at a fundamental level, and with the strives in accessibility in gaming made since its release im all but certain that would be alleviated in any kind of port. still an incredible game if you're Able to play it, but there shouldn't be a barrier like that in the first place"", ""In an unexpected sequel, Kid Icarus finds new light in an amazingly lighthearted world.

The bosses are all lackluster, though, except for the final boss. The final boss is awful.', ""When I played the PS3 version of the game as my first experience with the HD version of sonic unleashed, it was kinda frustrating. The medal hunting kills the pacing of the game if you are just trying to go through the levels, yet the game doesn't really make an effort to tell you to slow down and find all the medals since the quotas are usually manageable on their own before they get spiked for no reason at the very end. The levels are fun as hell though, I don't even really have a problem with the werehog outside of maybe a few werehog levels overstaying their welcome. The game just has a fun vibe to it, I like it. The framerate on the PS3 version also sucks, play the xbox version instead, preferrably on series X where it runs at 60 FPS and is incredible. If you play this just make sure to collect lots of medals and do as much stuff as you can so the game won't just cockblock you from finishing it near the end."", ""Sonic Unleashed isn't a terrible game but there are enough gripes I had with it that made the game a slog to beat. The werehog levels while sometimes enjoyable overstayed their welcome and the combat isn't all that great. The sun & moon coins were also a pain in the ass to collect for a good chunk of the game and will probably take up a good majority of your playthrough. It gets a bit easier to get the amount required to complete the game once you unlock the extra acts, but unless you really pay attention as you play the levels, you're going to find yourself replaying them quite a bit if you want to make progress. Eggmanland is one of the most infuriating levels I have played for quite some time. Not only does it have an absurdly big difficulty curve from every other level, but the level drags on longer than the other werehog levels.

Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly.

As a result, the ensuing disaster causes the Bubble Dreamer to go crazy and have nightmares. Although they are captured, Rayman and his friends are able to escape the Darktoons.

It was exclusively released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in August 1997.,"[""I've never seen a James Bond movie. The only intake of 007 media is from this game. And to be honest, until I played through the entire campaign on Switch Online, the only experience I had with this game was from glimpses of my cousins playing through the campaign or from the short bursts of multiplayer they'd allowed me to participate in. Playing through the game, I've realized how important this game truly is to the higher FPS canon. Non-linear levels based on objectives along with fast-paced gunplay. Varied weaponry that feels so good to maul down enemy combatants as they stalk you relentlessly. A smooth yet intense soundtrack from Grant Kirkhope. The dedication to its source material. Goldeneye is still one of the best movie to game adaptations in history and people who complain about the controls are missing the point. Yes, there are frustrating aspects to the gameplay, but when you get used to it, you realize you can gundown enemies with one hand and sip a glass of whiskey on the rocks in the other; letting the left trigger and the auto aim do the rest. I could‚Äôve made a shaken not stirred martini reference but I don‚Äôt know any Bond references that weren‚Äôt made in this game. I thought the Moonraker and Golden Gun were from this movie! They aren‚Äôt from Goldeneye??!!

I had owned this game for years and not even touched the singleplayer mode, so I finally got around to doing the actual campaign and its aight. The controls take some time to get used to for sure but once i got over the learning curve it was very smooth sailing. I think my main gripe with the game is just that I don\'t know how the game wanted me to play the whole time. Since the game was initially designed to be a gallery shooter before the devs switched to an FPS, the levels are designed with a lot of ""choke points"" where there are a lot of enemies and one way to proceed. Naturally, especially considering this game is a james bond game, the correct move would be to cautiously take out all the enemies before proceeding to the next area. Unfortunately the game continues to spawn enemies infinitely if you decide to stay in one spot too long, so sometimes a better play would be to throw caution to the wind and just run through everyone blasting them like its doom. Due to the fact that it\'s hard to tell how the game wants you to play for each level plus the fact that each level is rather open and nonlinear, allowing the player to get lost frequently, it all blends together to create a rather unbalanced gameplay experience. The soundtrack is good, and graphically the environments are very nice looking on the N64, with far draw distances for the system and not too much slowdown.

Every issue I had with Prime 1 was fixed. Better bosses, better world design, better puzzles, better beam combat. The only issue I can think of is that some of the bosses' weakpoint isn't conveyed to the player clearly which could make a couple of bosses on a first playthrough frustrating and a real slog"", ""Echoes, maybe fittingly for a game split between two worlds, can be equally compelling and frustrating. It engages novel ideas for the franchise ‚Äî inserting some survival horror mechanics into series that should be ripe for them ‚Äî and taking on noticeable creative risks with its doubled worlds and augmented difficulty. But it wears out its welcome well before the end with an overlong fetch quest that fails to recapture the flow of the first game's artifact hunt, and its world, while atmospheric and gloomy, only really has one aesthetically-arresting zone. Couple that with one of the worst final boss fights I've ever played and generally overburdened combat throughout, and it's a hard game to recommend to anyone who isn't already deep into the series' marginalia."", 'Taking pretty much everything the original game did, expanding, and refining it, Prime 2 is simply one of the best games in the entire Metroid franchise. The dichotomy of the Dark World allows the game to keep the backtracking elements Prime 1 was infamous for, but implement them in a way that is significantly less obtrusive and unintuitive. And while it takes a bit to get there, it has some beautiful art direction, with Sanctuary Fortress standing out as incredibly striking and beautiful, and I‚Äôm willing to bet it would look even better with an HD remaster like the first game got. Luckily, this game also rectified of Prime 1‚Äôs unfortunate flaws, a lack of an ending escape timer, and it does it in a great and memorable way, having you face off against Dark Samus in one of the coolest confrontations in the series while on the clock to the entire Dark Aether dimension being destroyed. Overall, this is an undeniable classic that anyone who is interested in Metroid should get around to playing.', '1 step forward, 1.01 steps back.

Rather than aiming for a lonely atmosphere like Prime, Echoes aims for a significantly more oppressive and terrifying feel, and it absolutely succeeds. The Dark Aether areas are genuinely unsettling at times, with their Silent Hill-esque music and body-horror visual design.\n                     \n                     It\'s hard to really elucidate what makes Echoes a little less great than Prime, but I think it really comes down to the backtracking. I know ""lmao Echoes backtracking"" is a meme, but it really does drag the game out longer than it needs to. In particular, returning to the Temple Grounds after every main area and the Sky Temple key hunt during the endgame are the biggest culprits.\n                     \n                     The much higher level of difficulty is also a point of contention in the community, but I always found Prime 1 to be a little too easy, to Echoes\'s greater challenge is welcome in my eyes. The final boss in particular was an excellent challenge.\n                     \n                     Overall, Echoes is still an excellent game despite not being quite as good as Prime 1, and in my eyes is nonetheless a worthy sequel that adds almost as much as it subtracts from Prime 1.', ""The coolest part about Metroid is being alone in a vast and hostile environment.

My first time experiencing Fire Emblem was through my sister recommending me to check out Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, citing it as a creation made by the team behind Super Paper Mario, which we loved dearly. Using the power of emulation, I got it completely playable on Dolphin, where she took the helm and played it the whole way through.

Instead of having only Manaketes as supposed ‚Äúsub-humans‚Äù which is a funny play on racism, the Manaketes were renamed to Dragon Laguz, because that‚Äôs what they are, essentially. Laguz are humanoid creatures that can turn into either Lynxes, Saber Toothed Tigers, Lions, Crows, Hawks, White Herons, and of course, Dragons.

When he was a kit, a gang called the Fiendish Five killed his family and divided up their book on the art of thieving: the Thievius Raccoonus. Sly must defeat all the members of the gang to recover the book while evading Carmelita Fox, a police officer chasing him around the world to apprehend him.
             

              This game is divided into five worlds, each themed around a particular part of the world and the villain headquartered there. Most worlds are structured as a central hub with entrances to numerous individual levels. Each of the levels has a primary goals which earns you a key. You must collect all the keys in the world to fight the world's boss.
             

              Many of the levels have a platformer structure. The objective of these worlds is to reach the location of the key. There are substantial stealth elements here as you must dodge searchlights and trips lasers which set off alarms and avoid alerting guards. In addition to the main objective, there are clue bottles to find. Finding all the clues in a level allows you to open a safe with a page from the Thievius Raccoonus which grants a new ability of some sort. After getting this, there is also a master thief sprint where you must get from the start of a level to the exit within a time limit.","[""This is one of the most frustrating platformers I've ever played. On one had the game's presentation oozes personality across the board from the artstyle, characters, locations; for a PS2 era game it's really impressive how good it looks by today's standards. On the other hand you have a collectathon platformer mixed with: one-hit kill system, rage inducing minigames, & floaty controls in game with many moments requiring precise input."", ""This is the most rage-inducing children's game I have ever fucking played. It's a fun game with some pretty cool levels but god damn some of the shit in here is fucking god awful. Any level that doesn't allow you to collect vault pages is the level I dread. Protecting that fat fuck Murray because he cowers like a bitch, that fucking crab level, the fucking chicken level, the fucking races, not to mention that fucking button memorization boss fight. The fucking buttons I pressed didn't register so I ended up failing and having to restart from the very beginning no matter how far I got. That's another thing, the lack of checkpoints in very critical parts of a level. When you have boss fights with multiple phases in a kids game, MAKE A FUCKING CHECKPOINT AFTER EVERY PHASE. You just spent 10 minutes trying to parkour over this lava and you died? FUCK OFF AND DO IT AGAIN!"", ""(Played before 2023)\n                     \n                     Ehhh, I liked this game but not really that much. Sly is a really cool character and I like the art style and some of the gameplay design, but I hate the SM64 style design of levels. Dying in one hit feels weird in this game and I can't explain why, but I was really craving a health bar halfway through. I also wish there were more modern urban environments like Paris or the casino level, but sadly that wasn't the case. It still was good though and I think it is a decent enough game, just not one I want to experience again."", ""Really stylish and fun. I liked the characters, liked the vibe, liked the stealth gameplay, just overall a fun time. The one-hit deaths were kinda annoying though but it do be a stealth-oriented platformer so avoiding combat is really your best bet.

It feels pretty atmospheric with some interesting music and you do feel like you're descending into this scary alien planet. Unfortunately, the lack of map and all the environments looking very similar (especially when it never got a colour version for the GBC) make it incredibly difficult to navigate. I know getting lost can sometimes be the point of these games but when you can't discern one area from another, it just becomes a frustrating experience.

I was originally going to write something longer about that game itself, pointing to how Game Boy games having a smaller technical scope, and perhaps a looser leash than their console counterparts, could enable them to explore more unique narratives.

It is also the third and final Fire Emblem series title to be released on the Super Famicom.
             

              Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 takes place between Chapters 5 and 6 of the previous game, Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu. Several characters from Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu appear, such as Leaf, Fin, and Nanna. It takes place in the Thracian peninsula in southeastern Jugdral.","[""There's genuinely nothing funny I could say about Thracia, or anything that hasn't already been said about it that would do it justice. There's no other FE game that matches its raw gameplay integrity and absolutely genius ideas, with Genealogy at least coming in close second. For every bullshit thing the game throws at you, the game gives you quadruple the amount of bullshit to use against the enemy - like there are so many brave and master weapons and staves that basically get handed to you on a silver platter, and while there are a few chapters that are trial and error, actually figuring them out genuinely feels so good - no other Fire Emblem game gives me this much dopamine. Hell, I made a long ass text file documenting my experiences with the game, going in depth on every strategy I utilised in every chapter and giving pointers and advice that either myself or someone else could use whenever they decide to play. I think it's worth mentioning that this is the first time a game has compelled me to do something like this."", 'amei as mec√¢nicas do jogo espero que apare√ßa em outros jogos ou algum futuro remake me diverti bem mais com esse comparado com o fe4\n                     \n                     envelheceu bem demais e algum dia vou revisitar mesmo com toda raiva que passei em alguns mapas', ""I'm never touching this game for the rest of my life. I have never felt such hatred inside of me until I played this game. The story and characters really carry this game. Take me back to Genealogy please. Also, fuck the ballistae in this game."", ""It's the kind of game that will kick in the stomach, laugh and continue to kick you, until it's get tired, but when it does, it will extend you a hand and treat you like a hero. Play it if you have some experience with tactical games otherwise you will have a bad time."", 'Oh my God. I can‚Äôt believe I slept on this game/ kept it for last thinking it would be too hard for me. Despite being on the SNES, it‚Äôs an absolute masterpiece of a game, which can be attributed to the fact it tests the SNES to its limits, being the final SNES game ever made, released in 1999, nine years after the SNES‚Äôs inception, and 3 years into the N64‚Äôs lifespan. Shouzou Kaga was evidently opposed to making a Fire Emblem game on the N64, believing the 3D graphics would hurt the appearance of his characters, and that philosophy to keep the characters 2D carried over to the PS1‚Äôs Tear Ring Saga: Yutona Heroes War Chronicles. That too went well, but let‚Äôs focus on FE5.', 'This game probably took about 10 years from my lifespan but i still loved it, the infamous difficulty of the game is actually really satisfying and well balanced especially in the first half, but after chapter 18 or so is.... painful, to say the least. Still, after strategizing for hours, constantly saving and loading states and rage moments,sense of accomplishment i get from beating a stage from a 24 year old SRPG is remarkable\n                     \n                     Probably my favorite aspect about FE5 is the overall tone of it. While FE4 had it\'s fair share of dark moments, this game is straight up depressing, you actually feel how bleak and despair the situation is in every chapter. By the beggining of the game, you feel completely lost,and confused by the mechanics and the difficulty, just like Leif, feeling lost on this brutal war. You are not a group of experienced and heroic knights, leading for victory, you are mostly common folk going against a full fledged empire, and you\'re obviously going to get obliterated against such force. But as you learn the mechanics of the game and gain strong units, a hope slowly rises, and you go from ""how the hell am i going to survive from this?"" to ""Hey, i can actually do this!"" and you start to command larger armies on bigger maps. And then, you are facing with the strongest forces of the Empire. It\'s actually even harder then before, but you have so much more experince with the game,you don\'t feel as powerless as before. And after you\'ve gone through so much, beating the game and seeing those credits rolled is one of the most rewarding feelings a game can give to you\n                     \n                     This, is phenomenal storytelling, and you can only have this in a videogame, that unforgiving difficulty is one of the finest examples of storytelling through gameplay. That\'s why remake of this game is probably going to suck, since they\'ll inevatiabely tone down the difficulty.\n                     \n                     Gameplay has a surprising amount of resource management, and i love this, you can capture enemies to steal their equipment,but it\'s significantly harder and risky to do,since you\'ll deal much less and take much more damage. But since you don\'t get much chance to buy and repair weapons, you really have to pay attention the resources you have, and use them in the most efficient way to overcome challenges you face\n                     \n                     Fatigue is also a new mechanic, which if you use a unit too much, you won\'t be able to use them in the next chapter, which makes powerful units more tricky to use, adding another depth to the gameplay. You\'ll only want to use them when necessary, so you actually have a reason to use less powerful units, i gotta say this was hard to get used to, especially after i obliterated every enemy with Ayra and Larcei in FE4, but it didn\'t took long to for me to actually like it\n                     \n                     Also fantastic map designs suplements the complex gameplay mechanics brilliantly. FE5 abandons the massive maps of FE4 in favor of smaller, but focused maps with multiple objectives, and while some enemy placements made me want to torn apart my bone structure from my skin(those goddamn ballistas will give me nightmares) for the most part i really apprecieted the variety in both the map design and objectives. You have defense, escape, fog of war(which isn\'t THAT bad in my opinion) and of course normal seize missions. Also each map has it\'s own unique objective, which makes every single map even more memorable. Varied objectives makes each chapter fresh, which is something i\'ve never seen in an SRPG\n                     \n                     Weakest part of this game imo are the characters, in FE4, you have a lot of optional conversations between characters, and those conversations actually give a decent personality and development to each unit, in FE5, most of the cast has 5 lines of dialogues at most, and all of them are in the chapter you recruit them.\n                     \n                     But i really like how the game tells what happened to them after the credits rolled\n                     \n                     Though this doesn\'t mean that this game has no good character writing, far from it, Leif is one the best written main character\'s i\'ve ever seen in a game. Like i mentioned before, you start of the game as powerless, and with zero knowledge on the complex mechanics of the game. Just like Leif, who\'s a 15 year old who has never commanded an army. This is obviously no coincidence, Leif represents the player, but unlike most games that have a main character which is""representing the player""Leif isn\'t a silent protagonist, his development from an inexperienced kid to a mature war commander is very natural, and paralells brilliantly with the development of you as a player, as you understand how the game works and start using the tools you have in the most optimal ways. Leif alone is enough to say this game has fantastic character writing\n                     \n                     I\'m not sure if Fire Emblem 5 is better than 4,but still, this is one the finest SRPG\'s ever made. It\'s frusturating for sure, but it\'s so well designed in nearly every aspect, it\'s impossible for me to hate it. I\'d highly recommend it if you liked FE4, and simply want to see more from this world.']",820,65,771,329,6584,fire emblem: thracia 776,SNES,1999.0,Strategy,Nintendo,0.0,0.0,0.26,0.0,0.26

Other than Command Mission or something I might play that.', 'This game is just high quality all around.\n                     \n                     With renewed visuals and grasping 2.5D gameplay, MMX8 is the finest entry of the franchise, brought alongside it\'s elements of combos, character swapping and the most mature plot ever, this PS2-era gem is usually underlooked, but it gives an almost perfect experience from beginning to end.\n                     \n                     Gameplay-wise, it plays like any other MMX game, but there are now segments where the game wants you to stack combos and damage enemies as fast as possible, alongside it\'s much better working character switch feature that, in the case that your character gets grabbed, you can swap them out quickly to get back on the fight. Bosses also function a lot better here, suffering much less from being stuck on the same spot for an infinite amount of time (aka Spark Mandrill Syndrome), now with an invincible enrage state where they do a mechanic that the player is forced to dodge around. Not only that, but when you do get damaged your HP bar still maintains a bit of the damage you took as Red, so if you swap your character out you can regenerate a bit of health (much like MVC, for instance!),I also really like that the chip mechanic swaps out finding heart tanks in the stages, specially considering the micromanagement of 3 different characters would become hell.\n                     \n                     Now, I praised most of MMX\'s stories before, but they were always a bit undercooked. X5 and X6 had a bit more to themselves, sure, but it suffered from bad translations, etc. X8 just.... feels so mature. It talks about this new generation of reploids replacing the old one, the cast being treated as somewhat obsolete by those Reploids, and what does it mean to become a Maverick. Is it a virus or do Reploids just have that free will to know what\'s best for them?

It\'s almost angelical vocals mixed with a calm guitar.... gosh, what a beauty of a track.\n                     \n                     As for the main antagonist...

Quite a shame we never got a X9 to see what would be of Axl, and maybe what X and Zero would do now that this new generation is bound to replace them.\n                     \n                     In many ways, it\'s almost meta how Mega Man X was left behind, never getting a proper new game (besides X Dive), being replaced by this new generation of games that seem to tackle it\'s subjects a bit better (Nier Automata being the first that comes to mind).\n                     \n                     I really, really hope a sequel comes someday, but...

When viewed from the lens of modernity, the stuff this game pulled off which likely seemed exciting at the time are no longer very impressive. I was 2 in 1995, so maybe I'm wrong, but the big features seem to be the size of the playable cast, the inclusion of large-scale battles, and the cinematic battle scenes.

Mario and friends are invited to the Baseball Kingdom to play games against each other. When Bowser hears this, he immediately interrupts the party.
             

              There are several game modes to choose from like in the previous game. In Exhibition mode, players play a single game against each other. Players can choose different options such as how many innings to play, if captains can use star powers (each captain has a different star swing and pitch), and toggle error items off and on (error items can be thrown at fielders).
             

              The single-player Challenge mode is different this time around. Instead of choosing a team captain, players start with Mario who must find teammates to take on Bowser Jr. and Bowser. Teammates aren't unlocked by playing a game rather they only join the team by clearing certain objectives. Most of the action takes place on areas with an overhead perspective; each area is based around a team captain.

Like in the GameCube game, players take turns batting to get points; a turn is granted to whomever grabs and holds the ball after a certain amount of time has passed.

The main designer and programmer for this game was Mark Turmell. Midway had previously released such sports games as Arch Rivals in 1989, High Impact in 1990, and Super High Impact in 1991. The gameplay of NBA Jam is based on Arch Rivals, another 2-on-2 basketball video game. However, it was the release of NBA Jam that brought mainstream success to the genre.
              
              The game became exceptionally popular, and generated a significant amount of money for arcades after its release, creating revenue of $1 billion in quarters. In early 1994, the Amusement & Music Operators Association reported that NBA Jam had become the highest-earning arcade game of all time.
              
              The release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games which were based around fast, action-packed gameplay and exaggerated realism, a formula which Midway would also later apply to the sports of football (NFL Blitz), and hockey (2 on 2 Open Ice Challenge).","[""The console ports of this game don't suffer from the coin-munching syndrome that is plagueing the arcade.

There is also a Super Saiyan mode that can be built up by filling up your rage/devil triggers/whatever; instead of making you superpowered for a small amount of time (like DmC) or giving you access to a massive attack that can curbstomp multiple enemies at once (like Blades of Time), it gives you the change to attack one enemy with a super special attack that gives you extra EXP. Combat in this game has no depth and feels like a repetitive chore; the lack of a parry, a decent dodge, or any combos beyond your basic ""tap X"" sequence is keenly felt.

Additionally, you also have to use perk points to unlock them only for specific weapons. Realize that the hammer sucks and want to use a greatsword? Too bad, you\'ve put all of your points into the hammer. It is true that you can respec later on, but this kind of game would have benefitted from a Skyrim-style system where you level up weapons ability based on using the weapon.\n                     \n                     The story is your usual high-fantasy bafflegarble; it\'s not great, but I\'m usually fairly lenient on bad stories as long as they aren\'t shoved in your face by ""cinematic"" cutscenes.

              The original Grand Theft Auto is made up of a series of levels each set in one of the three cities in the game. In each level, the player has a target number of points to achieve, and five lives to attain the score.
             

              The score counter doubles as a money meter; the player can spend this money on paint jobs and various other things. However, any money spent is of course taken away from the score, making the goal that little bit further away.
             

              On obtaining the target number of points, the player must then drive to a certain location to complete the level, which allows progress to the next one.","['It\'s where the series began and calling it ""rough"" is kinda sugarcoating it.

Assist Sonic to rescue Tails, who has been kidnapped by Dr. Robotnik in this platform video game.

The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.
             

              Guitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.
